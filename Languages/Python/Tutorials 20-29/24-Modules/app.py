# To find other people's
# modules, search "Python Modules".
# Make sure to the modules for
# your version of Python.

# pip is also used to get modules.
# pip is a package manager, for 
# python modules (it's the npm of
# python).

# I used "pip install python-docx" to
# install the python-docx module. When
# you install a module, it will install
# it in a folder called site-packages
# in your Python Environment folder.

# To uninstall a module, do 
# "pip uninstall <module>"
